## What is Impactor?
Impactor is an android free software that is made to remove root and to remove the operative system from modifications. It's fuly compatible with SuperSU, SuperUser, KingRoot, KingoRoot, Magisk and all other root managers
## How does Impactor work?
Impactor's unroot mechanism is the most advanced Android script, and it's fully compatible with all OS versions, custom ROMs and OEMs software customizations. It detects where `su` binary is placed and then it can shatter it. After this, Impactor will clean up the /system, /su and /data partitions searching backups residual, SuperUser files, data and APKs, Context-locked binaries and finally it remove all them in a single shot
## Is it safe?
Impactor v5.0.0 (70) and up are fully compatible with Nougat, they're faster than the previous versions and you can execute them without worry :D
